- Any relevant code snippets or error messages

### Suggesting Features

We welcome new ideas! To suggest a feature:

- Open a new issue with the `[Feature Request]` prefix in the title
- Describe the feature, its use cases, and why it would be valuable

### Submitting Code

We accept contributions in the form of pull requests. Here's how:

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork locally
2. Create a feature branch for your changes
3. Follow the [Style Guide](#style-guide) for coding standards
4. Add tests where applicable
5. Run all existing tests and ensure they pass
6. Commit your changes with clear messages
7. Push your branch and open a pull request targeting the main branch

We will review your pull request and provide feedback.

## Development Setup

To set up a local development environment:

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (e.g., cmake, ninja, gcc or your preferred compiler).

2. Clone the Lux repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lux.git
   cd lux
   ```

3. Build the project following instructions in the README (or specific build scripts).

4. Run to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   ./lux
   ```

## Style Guide

- Follow consistent indentation (4 spaces recommended)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Write clear and concise comments where necessary
- Use the existing code style as a reference (e.g., brace placement, spacing)
- Prefer explicit error handling and avoid undefined behavior

## Testing

Tests are important to maintain code quality. Before submitting a pull request:

- Write new tests for your features or bug fixes
- Run the full test suite to make sure everything passes
- Avoid breaking existing tests
