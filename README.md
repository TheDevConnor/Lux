## Introduction

Lux is a modern systems programming language designed to provide the performance and control of low-level languages while maintaining developer productivity and code clarity. Built from the ground up to address common pain points in systems programming.

## Why?

Modern systems programming often involves a trade-off between performance, safety, and developer experience. Lux aims to bridge this gap by providing:

- **Direct hardware access** without sacrificing code readability
- **Predictable performance** characteristics for systems-critical applications  
- **Developer-friendly tooling** that doesn't compromise on compile speed
- **Memory safety options** that can be opted into when needed

## Language Goals

- **🎯 Minimal & Explicit Syntax** – Avoid hidden control flow or magic
- **⚡ Fast Compilation** – Prioritize developer feedback cycles
- **🚀 Zero-Cost Abstractions** – Avoid performance penalties for convenience
- **🔧 Manual Memory Control** – Support fine-grained memory management
- **🛠️ Toolchain Simplicity** – No complex build systems required

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Early Development

Lux is currently in active development. Core language features are being implemented and the compiler architecture is being established. 

**What's Working:**
- Basic lexer and Allocater 

**Coming Soon:**
- Pratt Parsing, TypeChecker, and LLVM generation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following tools installed:

- **[Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)** - Build automation
- **[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)** - GNU Compiler Collection
- **[LLVM](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html)** - Compiler infrastructure
- **[Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/)** *(optional)* - Memory debugging
